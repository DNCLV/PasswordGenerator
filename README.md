# PasswordGenerator
Password Generator to create a random password from different inputs from the user(console).
The user determines whether or not the user wants uppercase, lowercase, symbols, numbers or a combination of the four in the password.
Furthermore the user determine the length of the password.

Improvement ideas:
Exception handling for console inputs(Scanner) - Example InputMismatchException on Scanner.nextInt(). My issue is that I cannot figure out how to return the value, if I use a try catch method to avoid the user, inputting the wrong in the wrong data type.
Password Validator - A validator that will deem a password secure or not, based on subjective values
Password Length requirement of minimum 8 characters.
