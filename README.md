# PasswordGenerator
The Password Generator is used to create a random password from different inputs from the user(console).
The user determines whether or not to use uppercase, symbols or numbers in the generated password.
Furthermore the user determines the length of the password to allow the user to state his/hers preferences.

The password generator is designed to be simple and userfriendly.

The program uses following:

* StringBuilder
* Conditional Statements
* Constructor
* For loops
* Math.random
* java.util.ArrayList
* java.util.InputMismatchException
* java.util.List
* java.util.NoSuchElementException
* java.util.Scanner

** Program is still in progress. See issues tab for future improvement ideas**
